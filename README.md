# Experimental Pregeometry Benchmark Workspace

> **Disclaimer:** This is a separate experimental pregeometry workspace, NOT the canonical UIDT v3.9 repository. Do not claim canonical UIDT v3.9 status. All physical interpretations derived from this workspace remain [D/E].

## Overview
This repository provides a leakage-safe pregeometry harness for exploring graph invariants, null models, and dashboard telemetry. 

## Setup & Installation
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the test suite: `py -m pytest verification/tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider`

## Governance & AI Audit Policy
All agents and contributors must adhere to the rules defined in `AI_AUDIT_POLICY.md` and the `AGENTS.md` steering baseline.
- **Rule:** Do not introduce physical constants, target cosmology values, Standard Model targets, or calibrated UIDT parameters into pregeometry growth rules, null ensembles, dashboards, or diagnostics unless a dedicated reviewed task explicitly requires it.
- **Rule:** Runtime artifacts must only be generated under `verification/data/pregeometry/`.

## Architecture & Ontology
The transition from v3.9 continuous primitives to v4.0 discrete structures is governed by the Phase 9 specifications. 
Please refer to the **[Phase 9 Architecture Handout](docs/architecture/phase-9-kernel-and-moduli.md)** for details on the Matrix-Thermodynamics kernel, the NCG-Filters, and the strict GLBC (Gap Localization before Construction) discipline.
